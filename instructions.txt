Here's how to run my front end.
You might have your own local server software and if you do i bet it is similar
but i used MAMP so that will be what these steps are for.
1) install MAMP from https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/
2) copy my twitter file and its contents into the htdocs file inside MAMP
3) open mamp and under preferences go to webserver and change the Document Root
      to my twitter folder
4) click "Open start page" and then under tools open phpmyadmin
5) create a database named "twitter"
5) add a user with the username "jackson" and password "root"
    make sure to give that user full permissions
6) refresh the page then on the left click the twitter database go to sql
      then drag my "twitter_db.sql" file into the window, this should run my make file
7) the project should now be ready to run, if you go to the users table you can see
      all the username password pairs in plain text, any one of those will let  you log in

if you have any questions email me
(hope you like it i spent so many hours not knowing how php to sql worked)
